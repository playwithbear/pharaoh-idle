# Advancements and Multipliers

## List of Advancement trees
- Click Work Button
- Items Owned (for each machine type)
- Total earned resources (Gold and Ankhs)
- Cats
- Amulets

### Click Work Button
**Key variable:** clickWorkTotal (+1 whenever you click any of the work buttons)
**Affected stat:** Slaves/tick

This advancement triggers based on the number of times you've clicked any of the work buttons (so long as you own the machine of course). Each new level reached increases the slaves/tick by a multiplier of 2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.).

The advancement levels are based on an exponents of 10, so you gain rewards at 10, 100, 1,000 etc.

### Items Owned (for each machine type)
**Key variable:** depends on each item. Scribes is 'scribes'
**Affected stat:** Production/tick

This is a more experimental one as I have a feeling it may accelerate the game beyond what is reasonable.

Will trigger a 2x multiplier at each of the following ownership levels: 32, 64, 128 etc. (basically an exponent of 2, starting at 2^5)

### Total earned resources (Gold and Ankhs)


### Cats


### Amulets
