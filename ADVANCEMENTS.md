This advancement triggers based on the number of times you've clicked any of the work buttons (so long as you own the machine of course). Each new level reached increases the slaves/tick by a multiplier of 2 (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.).

The advancement levels are based on an exponents of 10, so you gain rewards at 10, 100, 1,000 etc.
